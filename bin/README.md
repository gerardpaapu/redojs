There's places where I'm not allowed to use sh, but I've got node/npm.

I'm always interested in a better build system for my projects, and DJB's redo is interesting.

I guess this is kind of an attempt at an analogous design, but instead of .do files being executable scripts, they're commonjs modules that export an async function.
